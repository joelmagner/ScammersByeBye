# ScammersByeBye
A simple Python-script to mess with scammers.

**This script sends fake email and password information to scammers website-forms that will hopefully lead to them wasting time with fake information rather than getting a hold on some old peoples real info.**

To run the script, you need PIP/PIP3 and **import requests**
* $ sudo pip install requests

To modify the script to work, you need to get the POST-url & field-names(eg. Username, Password) from the network log (chrome console works fine) to the form that you want to flood.  


**Simple way to increase the length of the namelist in JSON-format.**

Get a bunch of names 

**^([A-Za-z]+)$**   **replace with:  "$1",**
