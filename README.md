# ScammersByeBye
A simple Python-script to mess with scammers.

* This script sends emails and password to forms so that scammers will waste their time with fake information rather than getting a hold on some old persons real info.

To run the script, you need PIP/PIP3 and import requests.
* sudo pip install requests

To modify the script to work, you need to get the field-name from the network log (chrome console works fine) for the form that you want to flood.
