# ScammersByeBye
A simple Python-script to mess with scammers.

**This script sends fake email and password information to scammers website-forms that will hopefully waste lead to them wasting their time with fake information rather than getting a hold on some old persons real info.**

To run the script, you need PIP/PIP3 and **import requests**
* $ sudo pip install requests

To modify the script to work, you need to get the field-name from the network log (chrome console works fine) for the form that you want to flood.
